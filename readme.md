md stands for markdown

#Heading: Personal Notes I Took While Learning Github
##Subheading 
"git clone git@github.com:hicazi2/spork.git" creates a copy of the repository in the folder we are working on.
"git status" command shows all of the files that were been updated or created or deleted. 
"git add ." tracks all files before commiting 
Alternatively, we can use "git specific.extension" command for tracking a specific file. 
' git commit -m "title" -m "description" ' is the command for commitment. There has to be a title.
e.g. 'git commit -m "title of the message" -m "second -m is for the description of the message"'

Note: Commitment is done locally. The changes aren't live on github yet. use "git push" to push the changes online.
