#Personal Notes I Took While Learning Github 
"git status command" shows all of the files that were been updated or created or deleted. 
"git add." tracks all files before commiting 
Alternatively, we can use "git specific.extension" command for tracking a specific file. 
"git commit -m" is the command for commitment. -m is for "message" and there has to be a message. 
e.g. 'git commit -m "message" ' It is better to explain the change in the message section. 

Note: Commitment is done locally. The changes aren't live on github yet. use "git push" to push the changes online.
